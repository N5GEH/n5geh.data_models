# Datamodels for Building Automation (Example)

This folder contains a script `data_models.py`,
where we define data models for a building automation system.
The models are based on the idea presented in [N5GEH Tutorial for Data Model](https://github.com/N5GEH/n5geh.tutorials.data_model).
After defining the models, we can use the automation utilities to generate JSON Schemas and OpenAPI documentation.
Besides, the interactive API documentation of each data model is also created and hosted via GitHub pages.
For this example, following documents are hosted:
- [Temperature Sensor](https://djs0109.github.io/data_models/example_building_automation/api_docs/swagger-ui/TemperatureSensorFiware/)
- ...
- TODO
